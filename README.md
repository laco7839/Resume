# Resume
For this project I worked on code.
# Process
I worked with Claude to create a resume. I then experimented with Figma and created several different iterations. However, I finally settled on the simple version that I used Claude to generate. I had hoped to use images, but Claude doesn't support pictures.

# Learnings
Working with code is a completely new expereince for me. It was very challenging to learn various methods of interactng with code and these new tools. However, after much practice and iterations, I now have a much better understanding and appreciaation for what computer code can do.
